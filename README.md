# Tailwind CSS Practice Project

This project was built as part of Dave Gray's Tailwind CSS tutorial, showcasing the utility-first approach of Tailwind for building responsive, modern web layouts. It demonstrates key features like custom layouts, responsive design, and how to extend Tailwind's functionality using custom configurations.
